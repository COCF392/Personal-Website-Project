            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Christopher. I was born on September 24th in 2008, making me 15 at the time <br>
                of writing this. I only have one sibling, that being my half-brother named Dejour. We've lived <br>
                in Massachussets for most of our lives, but in 2023, my mom and I moved down to North <br>
                Carolina, and my brother moved to New Hampshire to live with his now fianc√©e (my soon-to-be <br> 
                sister-in-law!).</p>
            <p>For school, I'm currently a rising sophomore at New Canaan High School in Conneticut. I'm able to <br> 
                attend this school thanks to the <a href="https://abetterchance.org/" target="_blank">ABC (A Better Chance) program</a>, which essentially allows me to <br>
                board for a non-boarding school. For the Summer of 2024, I joined a program called <a href="https://allstarcode.org/" target="_blank">All Star Code</a>, <br>
                which taught me about all things computer science and the tech industry, as I plan to land a job in <br>
                that field once I'm older. That program is actually the reason this webpage exists! This all part of <br>
                the 3rd week project. I hope you enjoy looking through it as much as I did creating it!</p>
