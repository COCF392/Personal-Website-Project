                <p class="hobby_paragraphs">I've loved playing video games for longer than I can even remember. Ever since my very <br> 
                    first gaming system, the 3ds, my interest with this pastime has hardly waned over the <br>
                    years. I intend to make my own game one day as part of a passion project. Out of the <br>
                    countless games I've played, a few have managed to stick out to me for being particularly <br>
                    excellent, and I could talk about them for days. See some of my personal favorite titles <br>
                    above.</p>

                <p class="hobby_paragraphs">I adore anything outdoors and related to animals! I enjoy taking walks on trails or even just <br>
                    around my neighborhood, but I like going out into nature and exploring even more! I'm <br>
                    always up for a hike up a mountain or a campout in the woods. My reverence for nature <br>
                    led me to join the Boy Scouts troop of New Canaan, which hosts plenty of outdoor-centric <br>
                    events. I also love the animals which inhabit the natural world as much as the world itself. <br>

                <p class="hobby_paragraphs">I've recentely started developing a deeper interest in music. My favorite genres are <br>
                    hip-hop and jazz, though I do also tend to listen to video game music of various genres <br>
                    as well. My favorite album is Late Registration by Kanye West, and my favorite musical <br>
                    artist is Tyler, the Creator, though MF DOOM comes in as a close second place. I want <br>
                    to start learning more about music production to see if I enjoy it enough to make creating <br>
                    music a new hobby.</p>

                <p class="hobby_paragraphs">I love art and all of the diverse mediums in which it can be represented. I find it so <br>
                    fascinating how it can allow people to share complex ideas and stories with one another <br>
                    while negating a language barrier. I'd say that my favorite medium would be visual arts; <br>
                    that being paintings, drawings, sculptures, etc. I took a photoshop class as one my <br>
                    electives as a freshman, and that allowed me to create various pieces of digital art, <br>
                    which you can see above. </p>
