                <p>As I said in my "About me" section, I aim to achieve a career in the tech industry through <br>
                    whatever form it may be; whether it's as a software, app, or game developer. The reason I'm <br>
                    so keen on earning a position such as this is simply due to the fact that I find technology <br>
                    and anything computers to be fun, challenging, and the key to leading humanity to new and, <br>
                    previously thought to be impossible, heights. I also make sure to maintain a growth mindset <br>
                    when creating aspirations for myself. As long as I believe that I can do something and keep <br>
                    putting in work to achieve that something, I'm bound to succeed eventually.</p>
                <p> I applied this mindset while my two teamates and I were developing a game together for the second <br>
                    week milestone project of the All Star Code Summer Intensive. We were given just a weekend to <br>
                    finish the entire thing, and I had tasked myself with writing most of the script. It was quite <br>
                    challenging and even tiring at points, but I didn't stop working on my part until I had created <br>
                    something which my teamates and I could be proud of. The main reason that I took most of the <br>
                    developement as my role was for me to personally challenge myself and see what I could accomplish <br>
                    under a strict time-frame. The image you see on the right is a snippet of the code I wrote for game, <br>
                    and the game itself can be played on my <a href="https://github.com/COCF392/ASC-Week-2-Project" Target="_blank">GitHub page</a>. There, you can also see various other projects <br>
                    that I have created, either as part of All Star Code or something I did during my free time.</p>
